Serve my JSON, damnit!
======================

**Disclaimer:** My JavaScript skills are to say the least, lacking.

However, I have on more than one occasion had a friend in dire need
of a quick and very dirty server that will return a snippet of JSON,
while prototyping a client.

This should do just that.

**Usage:**

    $ npm install -g serve-my-json-damnit
    $ ...
    $ serve-json /path/to/my.json
    listening on: 5000

**JSON format:**

Look in [`example.json`](example.json) for a super fast example, showing everything supported.
