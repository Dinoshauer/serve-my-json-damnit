Serve my JSON, damnit!
======================

**Disclaimer:** My JavaScript skills are to say the least, lacking.

However, I have on more than one occasion had a friend in dire need
of a quick and very dirty server that will return a snippet of JSON,
while prototyping a client.

This should do just that.

*Usage:*

    $ serve-json /path/to/my.json
    listening on: 5000

*JSON format:*

Look in [`example.json`][example.json] for a super fast example, showing everything supported.
